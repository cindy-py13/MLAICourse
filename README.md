A nontechnical report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.

# Report: Customers who did vs did not accept coupons

General Observations:
- Of all the coupon types, coffee house had by far the most (~32%), followed by restaurant < $20 (~23%), carry out & take away (~18%), bar (~16%), and restaurant ($20-50) (~11%).

## Bar Coupon Observations
- ~41% of bar coupons were accepted
- Those who were frequent bar goers (> 3 times a month) accepted coupons with ~77% and those who were casual bar goers (<= 3 times a month) accepted coupons with ~37%.
- Those who often went to a bar were more likely to accept a coupon.
- Drivers over 25 who went to a bar > 1 time a month accepted a bar coupon with ~68%. This tells us that perhaps it is just not the bar goer "level", but also that the odds of acceptance are a function of the age of the driver. All others that were not > 25 years old and had gone to a bar > 1 time a month had a 33% change of acceptimg the coupon.
- Being > 25 and having gone to a bar > 1 time a month makes you 2x more likely to accept a bar coupon.
- Those who went to a bar > 1 time with non kid passengers that did not work in the Farming Fishing & Forestry industry had a 67% chance of accepting the coupon while all others had a 29% chance.
- Individuals who went to bars > 1 time a month and were < 30 years old had a 80% chance of accepting a coupon while those who went to cheap restaurants > 4 times a month with < $50k income accepted coupons at 45%.
- Those who went to bars > 1 time a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed had a 77% chance of acceptance.
- Just going to a bar > 1 time a month does not necessarily mean that the chance of coupon acceptance is higher.

## Additional Investigation - Coffee House Coupon + Passenger Type Observations
- More alone passengers rejected the coupon (both genders) compred to accepted
- Friend(s) passenger type were more likely to accept the coupon compared to reject
- The distribution of acceptance/rejection in the kid(s) passenger category was pretty even and very low
- The distribution of acceptance/rejection in the partner passenger category was also pretty even but a bit higher than kid(s) category.
- The "Alone" passenger status has the largest counts with over 50% of all "alone" passenger rejecting the coffee house coupon
- Generally, across all passenger categories, married partner passengers tended to reject coffee house coupons equally often as they accepted
- Kid(s) passenger category is primarily dominated by married partners while parner passenger category is mainly comprised of married/unamrried partners.
- When with friend(s) passenger type, single people tended to accept the coupon more often.
